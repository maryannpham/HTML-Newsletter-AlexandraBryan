# HTML-Newsletter
This project was done as a collaborative peer programming effort, for our first project in the Moms Can: Code (MCC) Develop Camp program. 

The goal of this project was to create a recent news email newsletter with an assigned pictured template as our goal. 
My peer Laila and I decided to put a spin on the idea of recent news, by focusing particularly on the area of recent "feel-good" news as 
a way to counteract the overwhelmingly negative narrative generally found in the 24-hour news cycle. 

After deciding on our concept and building a color story, the newsletter was wireframed in Figment (email-layout.pdf) 
This gave us a guide when constructing our tables. We then used CodePen to build and debug the newsletter. 

Overall, this project was a solid introduction into the process of development - to conceive a project, map it out, build it (and search
for answers detailing how to build certain components), test it, fix it, then publish - all while collaborating with a peer and trying out 
hand at real-time pair programming.
